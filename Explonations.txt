 
 Here are some explonations about the functions that we used:
 
 
 
 address:main.html
 function: myFunction()
 
 The code starts by getting the input element from the document.
 It then uses a function to convert all lowercase letters into uppercase, and it loops through each of the li elements in ul.
 For each of these li elements, it gets an a element with textContent or innerText as its value.
 If this value is equal to filter, then it sets that li's style display property to none; otherwise, it sets its style display property to none.

 The code will loop through all the li elements in the ul and change their display to none if they contain a text value that is equal to or greater than the filter.
